Utilized probabilistic algorithms and scientific principles across four scenarios, determining acceptable risk levels for deliberate attacks and data breaches but identifying unacceptable risk levels for inadvertent and demonstration attacks, with recommendations provided to mitigate identified risks.Conducted a comprehensive risk assessment for a company's customer survey dataset to evaluate the potential for customer re-identification.
