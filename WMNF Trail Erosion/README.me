# ðŸ¥¾ Trail Erosion and Sustainability Analysis   
## Objectives   
This project assesses trail erosion risk in the White Mountain National Forest by integrating environmental and human activity factors into a composite risk index. By analyzing slope, precipitation, and trail popularity, the study identifies high-risk trails that require targeted conservation efforts. The findings support sustainable trail management strategies aimed at preserving ecological integrity while maintaining accessibility for recreational use.   
## Technologies and Skills   
* ArcGIS   
* Spatial Analysis   
* Environmental Modeling   
* Data Processing   
* Sustainability Assessment   
* Geospatial Data Visualization   
## Methodology   
Data Collection: Acquired elevation, precipitation, soil erosion risk, and trail popularity data from publicly available sources (USGS, NOAA, AllTrails, and gNATSGO).
Data Processing: Clipped and cleaned datasets to align with the White Mountain National Forest extent. Used GIS tools to compute slope and summarize risk factors for each trail.
Composite Risk Index Calculation: Combined trail use intensity, slope, and precipitation data using GIS analysis to create an erosion risk ranking.
Results Interpretation: Identified the top three high-risk trails and provided recommendations for erosion control measures and targeted maintenance strategies.
## Key Findings
Highest Erosion Risk Trails: Tuckerman Ravine, Ammonoosuc Ravine, and Crawford Path due to steep slopes and high precipitation.
Lowest Erosion Risk Trails: Dianaâ€™s Baths and Fishin' Jimmy Trail, which feature gentler slopes and lower precipitation exposure.
Recommendations: Implementation of erosion control structures, such as switchbacks and water bars, and strategic trail maintenance prioritization based on risk assessment.
## Future Enhancements
Incorporating additional environmental variables such as soil composition and vegetation cover.
Expanding the analysis to a broader range of trails beyond the 20 most popular ones.
Developing a predictive erosion model to forecast future risk under changing climate conditions.
